## FAQ

#### What the fuck is this?

The beginning of this file explains that

#### It uses the v4 or v5u Decomp?

It uses the RSDKv4 Decomp, and the Sonic 2 (2013) datapack. But you must enable the Origins game type in the settings.ini file

#### Will you fix the style clash?

Yes, but not now, that is planned for a future
